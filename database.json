      "instruction": "1. Cut the napa cabbage into quarters and remove the core. Slice each quarter into bite-sized pieces. Dissolve the sea salt in water and soak the cabbage in the brine for 2 hours.\n2. Rinse the cabbage thoroughly and drain well. In a large bowl, combine the cabbage with ginger, garlic, Korean red pepper flakes, green onions, fish sauce, sugar, and rice vinegar.\n3. Mix the ingredients well, ensuring that the cabbage is coated evenly. Transfer the mixture into a clean glass jar, pressing down firmly to remove any air bubbles.\n4. Leave the jar at room temperature for 1-2 days to allow the fermentation process to occur. Afterward, store the kimchi in the refrigerator.\n5. The kimchi can be enjoyed immediately, but its flavor will continue to develop over time. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to several months.",
